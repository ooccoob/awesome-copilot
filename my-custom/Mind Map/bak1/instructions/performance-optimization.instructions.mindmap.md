## 💡 核心规则与最佳实践

### 主要规范
- Measure First, Optimize Second:** Always profile and measure before optimizing. Use benchmarks, profilers, and monitoring tools to identify real bottl
- Optimize for the Common Case:** Focus on optimizing code paths that are most frequently executed. Don't waste time on rare edge cases unless they're c
- Avoid Premature Optimization:** Write clear, maintainable code first; optimize only when necessary. Premature optimization can make code harder to rea
- Minimize Resource Usage:** Use memory, CPU, network, and disk resources efficiently. Always ask: "Can this be done with less?"
- Prefer Simplicity:** Simple algorithms and data structures are often faster and easier to optimize. Don't over-engineer.
- Document Performance Assumptions:** Clearly comment on any code that is performance-critical or has non-obvious optimizations. Future maintainers (inc
- Understand the Platform:** Know the performance characteristics of your language, framework, and runtime. What's fast in Python may be slow in JavaScr
- Automate Performance Testing:** Integrate performance tests and benchmarks into your CI/CD pipeline. Catch regressions early.
