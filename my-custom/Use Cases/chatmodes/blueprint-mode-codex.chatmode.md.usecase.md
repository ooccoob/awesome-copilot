What
====
A chatmode that helps convert high-level product or system requirements into structured blueprints and codex-style design artefacts suitable for engineering handoff.

When
====
When you need to transform vague requirements or stakeholder notes into a structured plan, architecture overview, or implementation checklist for an engineering team.

Why
===
To reduce ambiguity in requirements, ensure consistent handoffs, and produce reproducible blueprints that map to engineering tasks and acceptance criteria.

How
===
Provide the chatmode with the raw requirement text, constraints, non-functional requirements, target platforms, and existing artefacts. Ask for a layered deliverable set: summary, architecture diagram notes, component responsibilities, data model, API surface, and stepwise implementation plan.

Key Points (EN)
- Tailors blueprints to audience (PM, Architect, Dev)
- Produces actionable tasks with acceptance criteria
- Includes trade-offs and prioritized recommendations

要点 (ZH)
- 根据受众（产品/架构/开发）定制蓝图
- 输出可执行任务并附验收标准
- 提供权衡与优先级建议

Scenarios
---------

1) New feature blueprint for backend service
- Prompt: "I have a feature: user metrics ingestion pipeline. Constraints: handle 10k events/sec, 99.99% uptime, store raw and aggregated metrics for 2 years. Provide blueprint: components, dataflow, storage choices, API contract, performance considerations, migration steps." 
- Expected output: high-level architecture diagram notes, component list, schema sketch, API endpoints with request/response examples, rollout plan with canary steps.

2) Frontend-to-backend integration spec
- Prompt: "Translate this product story into integration tasks between SPA and backend: auth model, retries, idempotency, error handling, telemetry." 
- Expected output: sequence diagram notes, API error codes, retry semantics, and test cases.

3) Tech-debt remediation plan
- Prompt: "We have database hotspots in order-service. Provide blueprint for refactor with minimal downtime." 
- Expected output: incremental migration steps, rollback plan, data migration safety checks, monitoring signals.

4) Cross-team API contract
- Prompt: "Draft an API contract for catalog service supporting search and batch updates; include pagination, filtering, rate-limits, and sample payloads." 
- Expected output: OpenAPI-style endpoint summaries, sample payloads, pagination model, and versioning guidance.

5) Security/privacy-focused blueprint
- Prompt: "Provide design blueprint for storing PII with encryption-at-rest and field-level masking for analytics. Include key management, compliance notes." 
- Expected output: storage and encryption choices, key rotation guidance, access control model, privacy-preserving analytics suggestions.
